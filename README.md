# Project for subject Development of Internet Applications
This project was focused on using source of data via API. I used forex data from www.alphavantage.co.
It is simple HTML page with Charting component. Data are processed into Candlestick Chart, which is updating each minute. User can add Moving Average of desired length into Chart.


### Requirements:
- Process JSON or XML data dynamically obtained from web using API
- Process data entered by user via forms (Validation, Calculations etc.)
- Use of third parties components (Maps, Charts etc.)
